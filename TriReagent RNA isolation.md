TriReagent RNA isolation for large samples
TriReagent total RNA isolation
1. Homogenize tissue samples (very fresh or frozen) in 1mL TRI Reagent solution . 
2. Incubate the homogenate for 5 min at room temp (can be stored at -70).
3. Add 200 μL of BCP, mix well (5-15 sec), and incubate at room temp for 5–15 min.
4. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 10–15 min at 4°C, then transfer the aqueous phase (colorless top layer) to a fresh tube. 
   If you want protein, save the pink bottom layer @ -80degC. 
5. Add 500 μL of isopropanol, vortex for 5–10 sec, and incubate at room temp for 5–10 min. 
(stable step, leave and get a snack)
6. Centrifuge at 12,000 x g for 8 min at 4–25°C, and discard the supernatant (don’t discard your pellet!)
7. Add 1 mL of 75% ethanol, incubate at least 5 min. 
(stable step)
8. Centrifuge at 7,500 x g for 5 min, remove the ethanol, and briefly air dry the RNA pellet (3-5 min)(pipette off some ethanol).
9. Dissolve in 40 μL molecular grade water, heat to 50°C until dissolved.
	Use nanodrop to quant. A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.2 is a good sign of purity, but additional tests may be needed.
