# Protocol



**Colony:**

We have two strains of ECB in Hahn lab: BE (bivoltine E-strain) and UZ (univoltine Z-strain)

1)	Adults: Cages for adults are kept in fly rooms. Separate rooms for each strain. 
              Feed with water

2)	Egg: 

    lay on wax paper. Collect eggs daily and store in containers. 
    
    store at the fly room

3)	Larvae: 

    feed on standard artificial diet for ECB larvae (Southland Products, Lake Village, AR, USA)
    
    grow at 16:8 L:D and 26 °C

4)	Pupae 
 
**Experimental rearing:**

1)	Diapause induction

    12:12 L:D and 23 °C 

2)	Diapause termination

    16:8 L:D and 26 °C 

    After 46 days in diapause induction condition, transfer diapausing larvae into diapause termination      condition. 

**Artificial diet**

1) measure 930*2=1860ml water and boil it with kettle

2) weigh 162*2=324g mix powder

3) add boiled water into blender, and turn on the blender, then add mix powder and votex for 4 mins

4) turn off blender and pour into containers

5) keep in friger after cool down
 


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
